# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## TL;DR
- Log every significant technical decision here (if wrong = 2+ hours to undo)
- Check this BEFORE making architectural changes — don't contradict past decisions
- Never delete/modify entries — append only
- To override a past decision: add a new ADR referencing the old one

## Planning Lessons — Specification gaps to check before every plan

These are categories of gaps that consistently cause bugs or delays. Use as a checklist when writing plans.

### Category A — External API contracts
| # | Gap to avoid | What the spec must include |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Hardcoding API values that are owned by the external service | "Names/IDs are enum values owned by the API. Always fetch from the API — never hardcode." |
| A2 | Assuming one global unique ID per entity across accounts | "Check whether the external system scopes IDs per account or globally. Dedup must match." |
| A3 | Undefined history window for sync/import operations | "Specify: how far back on first sync, how far back on subsequent syncs, whether user can control it." |

### Category B — Infrastructure & secrets
| # | Gap to avoid | What the spec must include |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | Unspecified secret format for hosting platform | "Specify exact storage format. Document that multi-line secrets must be stored single-line and reconstructed at runtime." |
| B2 | Relying on package extras for critical transitive deps | "Always pin transitive dependencies explicitly. Never rely on extras to pull in critical packages." |
| B3 | Env var formatting issues not anticipated | "After adding any secret to the hosting platform, verify in raw editor — no trailing chars, newlines, or quotes." |

### Category C — Framework behaviour
| # | Gap to avoid | What the spec must include |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | CORS middleware ordering left implicit | "State explicitly: CORS must be the outermost middleware layer. Register it last, after all middleware decorators." |
| C2 | External client instantiation outside error handler | "Every external client call at a system boundary must be inside the error handler. No exceptions." |

### Category D — Test design
| # | Gap to avoid | What the spec must include |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Single mock return_value reused across multiple DB calls | "State the multi-call mock rule before any test is written: use side_effect=[...] when the same chain is called more than once." |
| D2 | Assertions wrapped in conditional guards | "Never wrap assertions in conditional guards. Assert unconditionally — a missing row is a test failure, not a no-op." |

### Meta-lesson
Most bugs happen at **integration seams** — where two systems meet. Every plan must include an "Integration assumptions to verify" section per external dependency, listing format contracts, known edge cases, and how to validate before coding. See `3-ARCHITECTURE.md` Section 9.
